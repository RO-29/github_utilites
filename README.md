# GITHUB UTILITES

## GOAL

Set of tools to apply *Common* settings github repositories

It will be mostly in *golang*, feel free to fork this repo and submit PR's if you would like to see your tool in this repo

## Inspiration

It arises out of my personal need to manage multiple repos for the github organization and when I am feeling lazy to make the settings manually for each repo
